# Disaster response app

The present code presents an ETL and machine learning pipeline to categorize responses during a disaster. The dataset was provided by Figure Eight (now acquired by [Appen](https://appen.com), and contains pre-labeled tweets and text messages from real life disasters. This code cleans and reorganize the dataset to build a machine learning model. The model is able to tag a tweet or message with an appropriate response organization to help during an on-going disaster. During such threatening events, help organizations lacks the required capacity to filter the millions of tweets to focus on the real important ones. The machine learning model provided here can speed up the work on delivering medical supplies, water, or attending blocked roads.
